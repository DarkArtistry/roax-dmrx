# ROAX: Rod of Asclepius eXchange

NOTE: I was the lead engineer to launch one of Singapore's First Telemedicine App. The app was used by many users. The code base was also part of Vietnam's national telemedicine app during the pandemic.
I was also the core payments engineer for one of Singapore's largest online payments company. The partner that will work with me on this project is a Medical Doctor that has a Postgraduate for Computing and also a Post Graduate in Analytics.
I've have used the NUS research Library to do a thorough research before writing this paper. So if you think the technology is normal, it isn't.

Feel free to contact me for more questions: https://twitter.com/KernelKennethG or zhenhao.goh@comp.nus.edu.sg. :)

We are looking for people to build this community together.

[ROAX-whitepaper / "greenpaper"](https://github.com/DarkArtistry/roax-dmrx/blob/main/ROAX-greenpaper-version3.pdf)

A platform for doctors, medical professionals and patients to store verifiable medical records in a more secure, compliant and privacy preserving manner.

## Introduction

The healthcare industry faces significant challenges related to data security, record credibility, and a lack of incentives for medical professionals to cooperate. ROAX aims to address these challenges by providing a decentralized, immutable, and universally interoperable medical record system. This document outlines the vision, technical architecture, economic model, and potential applications of ROAX.

In the wake of previous medical system hacks, such as ransomware attacks and the SingHealth data breach, it has become evident that centralized storage of information presents significant security vulnerabilities. ROAX enhances security by ensuring that information is not only stored on a centralized authority but remains with the data owner. This decentralized approach significantly mitigates the risks associated with data breaches.

Furthermore, the credibility of medical records is crucial. Instances like a Singapore doctor who altered medical records for personal gain highlight the dangers of tampering with medical data. ROAX provides a secure and safer alternative through its immutable decentralized medical record system, ensuring that records cannot be altered without detection.

Another critical issue is the lack of sufficient incentives for doctors and medical professionals to actively contribute to the healthcare ecosystem. ROAX proposes a solution by creating an economic model that incentivizes medical stakeholders. By enabling a universally interoperable protocol, ROAX fosters cooperation and connectivity among various medical entities, promoting a more collaborative and efficient healthcare system.

ROAX is being built as a Layer 1 blockchain system focused on establishing a universal interoperable privacy-preserving medical record framework. This innovative approach offers numerous benefits:

- **Universal Interoperability:** ROAX provides a framework that allows Decentralized Medical (DeMed) applications, such as insurance services, to be built on top of the core blockchain layer, promoting widespread adoption and integration.
- **Immutable, Privacy-Preserving, and Verifiable Records:** The system ensures that medical records are immutable and verifiable while preserving patient privacy.
- **Patient Ownership:** Patients maintain ownership of their medical records in a secure manner, giving them control over their personal health information.
- **Cooperative Incentives:** For the first time in many years, ROAX gives doctors and medical professionals a voice and a stake in the system, providing incentives to cooperate and contribute to a universal healthcare network.

ROAX is not a disruptive technology; rather, it catapults the existing healthcare system into a universal interoperable network, evolving the current system into humanityâ€™s next healthcare system. This transformative approach aims to enhance the security, credibility, and efficiency of medical records, ultimately benefiting patients, healthcare providers, and the entire medical ecosystem for humanity.
